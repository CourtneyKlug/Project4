This panda3d project allows you to take a gander at some planets, 
and a space station, all of which are located in an unknown part of the universe. 
You can also see the x y and z circles, a gathering of drones over a planet, and drones that make
the seams of a baseball over a different planet. The drones are our friend by the way. You're seeing all of this from the perspective of the Player SpaceShip. 
This machine can move left, right, up, down, and it can even roll to the left or the right. It can propel
fowards too of course. It's also able to bump into the 6 planets, the universe itself, and the drones. 
This is part 4 of the Space Jam project.
